This repository contains scripts that I use to quickly setup projects either on a local Git server or on GitHub.

## Branches

There are four branches.

- Development
- Testing
- Staging
- Production

### **Development**

This branch contains development code. Don't grab code from here unless you like the challenge of trying to make a complete strangers unfinished code work. Die hards only.

### **Testing**

This branch contains testing code. Working code from development ends up here. This code likely works and is being tested in a testing environment. Use at your own risk.

### **Staging**

This branch contains staging code. Working code from testing ends up here. Chances are, this code does work and is being staged in a staging environment. Give it a whirl if you like living on the edge.

### **Production**

This branch contains production code. Working code from staging ends up here. Play it safe and use this code if you are looking for something that 'works out of the box'.

## Licence

I'm not an expert coder. In fact, I'm not a great or even a good coder. I'm more like a 'just good enough' coder. Just good enough to write a script to get a job done. Feel free to browse and reuse my scripts as you wish. Give credit where credit is due (as have I).

If you don't, that's ok, but just keep in mind that all I want to do is save you from embarrassment, should you publicly claim it as your own. After all, I'm not an expert coder.
