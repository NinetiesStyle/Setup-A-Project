I'm not an expert coder. In fact, I'm not a great or even a good coder. I'm more like a 'just good enough' coder. Just good enough to write a script to get a job done. Feel free to browse and reuse my scripts as you wish. Give credit where credit is due (as have I).

If you don't, that's ok, but just keep in mind that all I want to do is save you from embarrassment, should you publicly claim it as your own. After all, I'm not an expert coder.
