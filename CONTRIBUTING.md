This repository contains scripts that I use to quickly setup projects either on a local Git server or on GitHub.

## Contributing

If you would like to contibute to any of my 'just good enough' scripts, please contact me via [email](me@nineties.style) and we'll sort something out. This public GitHub thing is still a bit new to me. I'm sure there is a way to automate the whole shebang, so just bear with me in the mean time.
