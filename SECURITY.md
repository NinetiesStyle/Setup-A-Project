# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It's pretty straight forward.

If you are using a script from **production**, it's supported.

If you are using a script from **staging, testing or development**, *it's not supported*.

| Version     | Supported          |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Production  | :white_check_mark: |
| Staging | :x: |
| Testing | :x: |
| Development | :x: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you would like to report a vulnerability or something of the sort, send me an [email](me@nineties.style) and I'll try to resolve it as quickly as possible. Bonus points for those that send me the solution as well ;-)
